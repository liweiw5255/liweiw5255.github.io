**Short bio**

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in Electrical, Compute, and System Engineering Department at  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, working with Dr. Zheyu Zhang. Before joining RPI, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Clemson University, advised by Dr. Shuangshuang Jin. My research interests include high-performance computing, power electronics simulation and reliability assessment.
